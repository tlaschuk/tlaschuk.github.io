Using its radar and stealthy infra-red search and track system, the Flanker can employ a wide array of radar and infra-red guided missiles. The Flanker also includes a helmet-mounted sight that allows you to simply look at a target to lock it up!

First used in operations in 1995 aboard the carrier Admiral Kuznetsov, the fighter officially entered service in August 1998, by which time the designation \"Su-33\" was used. Compared with the Su-27, the Su-33 has a strengthened undercarriage and structure, folding wings and stabilators, all for carrier operations. The wings are larger than on land-based aircraft for increased lift. The Su-33 has upgraded engines and a twin nose wheel, and is air refuelable. In 2009, the Russian Navy ordered the MiG-29K as a replacement for the Su-33.",

The MiG-21, in all of its' variants, has fought in wars stretching all the way from the Vietnam War in the 1960's to the modern day Syrian Civil War. Owing to it's unique blend of versatility, ruggedness and maintainability, the MiG-21 remains in active service to this very day. Initially designed as a pure-bred interceptor, the MiG-21 has over the years evolved into a hybrid multi-role aircraft. In addition to a vast Air-to-Air arsenal, it can effectively employ unguided rockets, bombs and radar-guided missiles to destroy ground or naval targets.",

Its success led to extended production runs of more than 7,800 aircraft between 1949 and 1956. The Canadair Sabre added another 1,815 airframes, and the significantly redesigned CAC Sabre (known as the Avon Sabre or CAC CA-27), had a production run of 112.

Notable features include the use of a powerful gas turbine engine, the adoption of sophisticated composite armour, and separate ammunition storage in a blow-out compartment for crew safety. Weighing 68 tons, it is one of the heaviest main battle tanks in service. The M1 remains the principal main battle tank of the United States Army and Marine Corps, and the armies of Egypt, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Australia and Iraq.
