        <p class="faq_question">What does MapleFlagMissions.ca do?</p>
        <p class="faq_answer closed">We create combat simulator missions for the <a href="https://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com/en/index.php" target="_blank">Digital Combat Simulator</a>.</p>

      <div class="faq">
        <p class="faq_question">How do I install and use these missions?</p>
        <p class="faq_answer closed">For the Pay to Play missions you need to register an SUID (System Unique ID).  Then when you make your purchase we will send you a mission key and password.  Then you download the campaign or mission package and you will get a .miz file. Rename the .miz extension to .exe and run that file. Some browsers may change the .miz to .man or some other extension. If you rename the extension to .exe that should allow you to run the program. Once run it will prompt you for the mission key and then install the file into the default mission directory for the game or you can change it if you have installed your game to another directory. To use the mission just select it within the game. Please consult our File installation guide PDF available <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4GJ-2wKWbw_b3JfcGdKREZNRkE/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

        <p class="faq_question">How do I install the documentation packages?</p>
        <p class="faq_answer closed">When you download the documentation package you will get a .miz file. Rename the .miz extension to .exe and run that file. Some browsers may change the .miz to .man or some other extension. If you rename the extension to .exe that should allow you to run the program. Once run it will prompt you for the mission key and then install the file into the default document directory for the game or you can change it if you have installed your game to another directory. To use the documentation select it from the Start Menu, All Programs, MapleFlagMissions, DCS World folder.

      <div class="faq">
        <p class="faq_question">I don't have a Mission Key. What do I do?</p>
        <p class="faq_answer closed">For the pay to play missions you need a Mission Key to install the Mission files. To get a Mission Key you have to install a License program first which creates a System Unique Id (SUID). You send us the SUID and we generate the Mission Key and send it back to you. Please consult our License File installation guide PDF available <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4GJ-2wKWbw_ZUxlNUVpWjdKcHc/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

      <div class="faq">
        <p class="faq_question">My Mission Key does not work. What do I do?</p>
        <p class="faq_answer closed">Check for leading or trailing spaces when you enter the mission key. If it still fails it could be because the SUID Key has changed due to other changes on your system. You can check if your SUID Key is still valid by downloading the SUID Key Check program <a href="http://www3.sympatico.ca/tlaschuk/mapleflagmissions/SUID_CHECKER.V1.0.exe" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="faq">
        <p class="faq_question">My SUID has changed, can I get new Mission Keys to match?</p>
        <p class="faq_answer closed">Yes. Email us the new SUID and we will generate new Mission Keys for you. Requests are monitored and if signs of abuse are detected we reserve the right to disallow future Mission Key generation.</p>

      <div class="faq">
        <p class="faq_question">How do I un-install these missions?</p>
        <p class="faq_answer closed">Under the Start menu in the folder called MapleFlagMissions you will find an Uninstall program. Just run it for the mission you want to un-install.</p>

      <div class="faq">
        <p class="faq_question">What is the difference between free and &quot;Pay to Play&quot; missions?</p>
        <p class="faq_answer closed">The free missions have no installer so you can put them into the missions folder as they are downloaded and you can play them for free. The "Pay to Play" missions are painstakingly researched for the ultimate in realism and immersion. They have enhanced functionality like more realistic maps and diagrams, accurate radio calls, more ground and air traffic, and busier, more realistic airport settings. They strive for the highest level of realism and immersive game play. The "Pay to Play" missions are priced on a per mission basis and you need a mission key to unlock the mission and install them.</p>

      <div class="faq">
        <p class="faq_question">How do I install and play the &quot;Play to Pay&quot; missions?</p>
        <p class="faq_answer closed">You need both a System Unique ID and a Mission Key to unlock the "Pay to Play" missions. You can obtain both from the request a license page <a href="/license" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

      <div class="faq">
        <p class="faq_question">Why such a complicated key scheme?</p>
        <p class="faq_answer closed">This is a requirement from TFC/ED for paid content. Free content is not wrapped in an installer and can simply be downloaded and installed as is.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="faq">
        <p class="faq_question">Do I have to buy a new mission key for updates or patches to missions I have already paid for?</p>
        <p class="faq_answer closed">No. Since you paid for the mission you will be registered in our customer database and all future updates and patches will be free. In most cases your existing Mission Key will work for the update or patch. Where a new Mission Key is required it will be emailed to you.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="faq">
        <p class="faq_question">What about viruses? Can my computer get infected by installing your missions?</p>
        <p class="faq_answer closed">No. We use a current, popular Anti-Virus program to scan all files before uploading. We do all the mission creation in house so there is no risk of a 3rd party introducing unwanted content.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="faq">
        <p class="faq_question">What operating systems are your missions written for?</p>
        <p class="faq_answer closed">Currently it is Windows based: XP, Vista, Windows7, Windows8 and Windows10. We are highly dependent on the platform chosen by the game developer.</p>
